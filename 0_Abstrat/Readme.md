## INTRODUCTION :- 


Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper .
