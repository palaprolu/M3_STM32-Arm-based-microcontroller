# WIPING CONTROL SYSTEM :-

## INTRODUCTION :- 


Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper .

## HISTORY OF STM32 MICROCONTROLLER :- 

STM32 is a family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits by STMicroelectronics. The STM32 chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same 32-bit ARM processor core, such as the Cortex-M33F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, or Cortex-M0. Internally, each microcontroller consists of the processor core, static RAM, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.

## USE OF STM32 MICROCONTROLLER :- 

These microcontrollers are used in a variety of applications, from simple printers to complex circuit boards in vehicles. As a result, the technical know how of developing firmware and embedded systems using STM32 microcontrollers are an essential skill-set for an engineer in electronics and communications
