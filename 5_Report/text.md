## OBJECTIVES :- 

The rain sensor is placed over the windshield and the servo motor powers the wiper blades, which are directly connected to the motor. When the signal is received, the arduino Uno microcontroller is attached to all of the three components, namely, the rain sensor, the servo motor and the LCD. The microcontroller unit is placed inside the car and is attached to a dc source; The LCD is also in the car near the driver‚Äôs seat. It displays the speed of the wiper blades along with the intensity of the falling rain.

## ADVANTAGES üëé
* Car wiper able to clean the whole area of the windshield
* It can increase the safety of the car which can help the diver to drive safely because the whole area is cleaned.
* Economy When we look at the regular mechanism and bases of the car wiper , we can see that the car has two wiper, each wiper has a separate bases.

## DISADVANTAGES :- 

* The disadvantage is that the upper right corner of the windshield in the co driver's position can't be scraped, which may cause a blind area.
* They add to the total purchase of the vehicle. When broken, repairs can be expensive as only experts can fix the system.
* One of disadvantages is the sensitivity to external light.

## APPLICATIONS :- 

* Windscreen wiper is a device that cleans water
* Snow or mud from the windscreen of vehicle
* It ensures proper visibility of the road ahead
* This system finds application on a large variety of locomotives from vehicles, railways to aero-planes.
